K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.

It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover
the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.

It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. 
The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.
